# Art Gallery  

An **interactive art gallery web experience** built with **React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion**.  
This project combines **visuals, motion, and sound** to create a surreal, immersive way of exploring artwork.  

When you scroll, artworks reveal themselves with **smooth animations and glitch effects**, while subtle **ambient sounds** play when hovering over each piece, making the gallery feel alive.
